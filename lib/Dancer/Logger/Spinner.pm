=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # in your Dancer app:
    setting logger => 'spinner';

    # or in your Dancer config file:
    logger: 'spinner'

Et voila!

=head1 DESCRIPTION

When using this logger and running your application in the terminal, you will
see a text spinner running on each message it gets. If you have a page with a
lot of request, and they will come in fast, you'll see the spinner running. If
you have an app with very little requests in each page or if it is slow, the
spinner will run slowly.

Each request matches another rotation of the spinner.
